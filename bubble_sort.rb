# so, I think for loop is the best way to do this
# make a loop that compares array[i] aka one item to array[i+1] 
# if left is bigger than right swap them
# for that ill have to introduce a 3 variables 
# so I don't end up losing the value of one of the array items
# it should technically iterate array.length-1 
# but ill also add a thing that checks if the array 
# changed in comparison to the previous iteration
